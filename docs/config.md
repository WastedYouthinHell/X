# Configuration 

The application is designed to be highly configurable, but to also come 'out of the box' with sensible defaults.

The defaults that have been chosen should cover the vast majority of users, but deployments on low spec hardware (such as a single board computer, or a shared system) should monitor resource usage and adjust as necessary.

Credentials (username and password) for the Soulseek network are the only required configuration, but it is advised to also change the credentials for the web UI.

# Sources

The application supports several different configuration sources in order to make it easy for users to deploy the application in a variety of situations.

The configuration options used by the application are derived from the values specified by each of the sources, with sources higher in the heirarchy overwriting (or sometimes adding to) configuration specified lower in the heirarchy.  The heirarchy is:

```
Default Values < Environment Variables < YAML Configuraiton File < Command Line Arguments
```

Some options can be specified as lists.  In these cases, care should be taken when combining configuration from multiple sources, as the way the .NET framework overlays configuration from different sources is additive, but it also overwrites, meaning that if a list of `one;two;three` is defined in an environment variable for an option, and the YAML configuration specifies a list of `foo` and `bar`, the resulting configuration will be a list containing `foo, bar, three`.

## Default Values

Default values for each option (unless the default is `null`) are specified in `Options.cs`.  Upon startup these values are copied into the configuration first.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are loaded after defaults.  Each environment variable name is prefixed with `SLSKD_` (this prefix is omitted for the remainder of this documentation).

Environment variables are ideal for use cases involving Docker where remote configuration will be disabled, and where configuration is not expected to change often.

Some options are backed by arrays or lists and allow multiple options to be set via a single environment variable.  To achieve this, separate each list item by a semicolon `;` in the value:

```
SLSKD_SOME_OPTION=1;2;3
```

## YAML Configuration File

Configuration is loaded from the YAML file located at `<application directory>/slskd.yml` after environment variables.  The location can be changed by specifying the path in the `CONFIG` environment variable or `--config` command line argument.

The application watches for changes in the YAML file and will reload configuration when they are detected.  Options will be updated in real time and transmitted to the web UI.  If a server reconnect or application restart is required for changes to fully take effect, a flag will be set indicating so.

The YAML file can be read and written at run time via API calls, or can be edited on disk.

If no such configuraiton file exists at startup, the example file `/config/slskd.example.yml` is copied to this location for convenience.

YAML configuration should be used in most cases.

## Command Line Arguments

Command line arguments are loaded last, override all other configuration options, and are immutable at run time.

Command line arguments are useful for security options, such as remote configuration, HTTPS JWT secret and certificate.  Choosing this source for sensitive options can prevent a remote attacker from gaining full control over the application.

Some options are backed by arrays or lists and allow multiple options to be set via command line.  To achieve this, repeat the command line argument:

```
--some-option 1 --some-option 2 --some-option 3
```

# Remote Configuration

The application contains APIs for retrieving and updating the YAML configuration file.  By default, this option is disabled.  Applications that will be run within untrusted networks, especially those where the application is internet-facing, should consider the risks of enabling this option.

If an attacker were to gain access to the application and retrieve the YAML file, any secrets contained within it will be exposed.

| Command Line             | Environment Variable   | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--remote-configuration` | `REMOTE_CONFIGURATION` | Determines whether remote configuration of options is allowed |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
remote_configuration: false
```

# Application Directory Configuration

The application directory configuration option determines the location of the YAML file, the default locations of the download and incomplete directories, and the location of application working data, such as logs and SQLite databases.

Because the location of the YAML file is derived from this value, it can't be specified within the YAML file and must instead be specified with the `APP_DIR` environment variable or `--app-dir` command line argument.

If no value is specified, the location defaults to either `~/.local/share/slskd` (on Linux and macOS) or `%localappdata%/slskd` (on Windows).

Within the official Docker image, this value is set to `/app`.

# Other Directory Configuration

## Incomplete and Downloads

By default, incomplete and downloaded files are saved in `APP_DIR/incomplete` and `APP_DIR/downloads`, respectively.  The application will create these directories on startup if they don't exist.

Alternative locations can be specified for each directory.  Directories must exist and must be writable by the application; the application will not attempt create them.

| Command Line      | Environment Variable | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-o\|--downloads` | `DOWNLOADS_DIR`      | The path where downloaded files are saved     |
| `--incomplete`    | `INCOMPLETE_DIR`     | The path where incomplete downloads are saved |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
directories:
  incomplete: ~
  downloads: ~
```

## Shares

Any number of shared directories can be configured.

Paths must be absolute, meaning they must begin with `/`, `X:\`, or `\\`, depending on the system. Relative paths, such as `~/directory` or `../directory`, are not supported. Sharing a root mount on a unix-like OS (`/`) is also not supported.

Shares can be excluded by prefixing them with `-` or `!`.  This is useful in situations where sharing a subdirectory of a share isn't desired, for example, if a user wanted to share their entire music library, but not their personal recordings:

```yaml
directories:
  shared:
    - 'D:\Music'
    - '!D:\Music\Personal Recordings`
```

Shares can be aliased to improve privacy (for example, if a username is present in the path).  A share alias can be specified by prefixing the share with the alias in square brackets, for example:

```yaml
directories:
  shared:
    - '[Music]\users\John Doe\Music'
```

If no alias is specified, the name of the shared folder is used (e.g. `D:\Music` is aliased to `Music`). To a remote user, any files within the aliased path will appear as though they are shared from a directory named as the alias.

Aliases:
* Must be unique
* Must be at least 1 character in length
* Must not contain path separators (`\` or `/`)

| Command Line   | Environment Variable | Description                       |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `-s\|--shared` | `SHARED_DIR`         | The list of paths to shared files |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
directories:
  shared:
    - ~
```

# Limits and User Groups

## Global

Global limits behave as a hard limit, additive across all groups.  These values should be set as high as practical for the environment in which the application is running; more granular controls should be defined at the group level.

A change to slot limits require an application restart to take effect, while speed limits can be adjusted at runtime.

| Command Line             | Environment Variable   | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--upload-slots`         | `UPLOAD_SLOTS`         | The limit for the total number of upload slots   |
| `--upload-speed-limit`   | `UPLOAD_SPEED_LIMIT`   | The total upload speed limit                     |
| `--download-slots`       | `DOWNLOAD_SLOTS`       | The limit for the total number of download slots |
| `--download-speed-limit` | `DOWNLOAD_SPEED_LIMIT` | The total download speed limit                   |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
global:
  upload:
    slots: 20
    speed_limit: 1000
  download:
    slots: 500
    speed_limit: 1000
```

## Groups

User groups are used to control upload slots, speed limits and queue behavior on a per-user basis.

Each group has a priority, starting from 1, that determines the order in which groups are prioritized in the upload queue.  A lower number translates to higher priority.  Upload slots are granted to higher priority groups before lower priority groups.

Groups have a queue strategy, which can be either `FirstInFirstOut`, or `RoundRobin`.  This setting determines how uploads from multiple users in the same group are processed; `FirstInFirstOut` processes uploads in the order in which they were enqueued, while `RoundRobin` processes uploads in the order in which the user was ready to receive the upload.

Upload slots and speed limits configured at the group level can be used to create constraints in addition to global settings.  If group-level limits exceed global settings, global settings become the constraint.  Slots and speed limit settings default to `int.MaxValue`, effectively deferring to the global limits.

The general configuration for a group is as follows:

#### **YAML**
```yaml
upload:
  priority: 500 # 1 to int.MaxValue
  strategy: roundrobin # roundrobin or firstinfirstout
  slots: 10 # 1 to int.MaxValue
  speed_limit: 100 # in KiB/s, 1 to int.MaxValue
```

## Built-In Groups

The `default` built-in group contains all users that have not been explicitly added to a user defined group, are not privileged, and that haven't been identified as leechers.

The `leechers` built-in group contains users that have not been explicitly added to a user defined group, are not privileged, and that have shared file and/or directory counts that are less than the configured `thresholds` for the group.  By default, users must share at least 1 directory with 1 file to avoid being identified as leechers.

The `privileged` built-in is used to prioritize users who have purchased privileges on the Soulseek network.  This groups is not configurable, has a priority of 0 (the highest), a strategy of `FirstInFirstOut`, and can use any number of slots, up to the global limit.

It is not possible to explicitly assign users to built-in groups, but the priority, number of slots, speed and queue strategy can be adjusted (excluding `privileged`).

#### **YAML**
```yaml
groups:
  default:
    upload:
      priority: 1
      strategy: roundrobin
      slots: 10
      speed_limit: 50000
  leechers:
    thresholds:
      files: 1
      directories: 1
    upload:
      priority: 99
      strategy: roundrobin
      slots: 1
      speed_limit: 100
```

## User Defined Groups

Any number of user defined groups can be added under the `user_defined` key in the group configuration.

User defined groups use the same configuration as built-in groups, but additionally allow a list of `members` containing the usernames of the users assigned to the group.

Users can be assigned to multiple groups, with their effective group being the highest priority (lowest numbered) group.  If a user has privileges on the network, any explicit group membership is superceded, and their effective group is the built-in `privileged` group.  If a user is explcitly assigned to a group, they will not be identified as a leecher.

#### **YAML**
```yaml
groups:
  user_defined:
    my_custom_group_name:
      upload:
        priority: 500
        strategy: roundrobin
        slots: 10
        speed_limit: 100
      members:
        - bob
        - alice
```

## Example

In the following example:

* All leechers share 1 slot among them, and can download at a maximum speed of 100 KiB/s.  Leechers can only download if there are fewer than 20 other uploads in progress to other users.
* Users that aren't leechers and that aren't in the `my_buddies` group (`default` users) share 10 slots among them and can download at the global maximum speed of 1000 KiB/s, but only if fewer than 20 upload slots are being used by users in the `my_buddies` group.
* Users that are in the `my_buddies` group share 20 slots among them and can download at the global maximum speed.  10 upload slots are reserved for users in this group, and users `alice` and `bob` are members.

```yaml
global:
  upload:
    slots: 20
    speed_limit: 1000
  download:
    slots: 500
    speed_limit: 1000
groups:
  default:
    upload:
      priority: 500
      strategy: roundrobin
      slots: 10
  leechers:
    upload:
      priority: 999
      strategy: roundrobin
      slots: 1
      speed_limit: 100
  user_defined:
    my_buddies:
      upload:
        priority: 250
        queue_strategy: firstinfirstout
        slots: 20
      members:
        - alice
        - bob
```

# Soulseek Configuration

The Soulseek configuration determines how slskd will interact with the Soulseek network and underlying [Soulseek.NET](https://github.com/jpdillingham/Soulseek.NET) library.

## Username and Password

The credentials used to log in to the Soulseek network.

Changing either of these values requires the server connection to be reset.

The password field is not included when serializing options to Json or YAML to avoid inadvertently exposing the value.

| Command Line      | Environment Variable | Description                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `--slsk-username` | `SLSK_USERNAME`      | The username for the Soulseek network |
| `--slsk-password` | `SLSK_PASSWORD`      | The password for the Soulseek network |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  username: <username>
  password: <password>
```

## Distributed Network

Options for the Soulseek distributed network, which is how search requests are delivered.

The distributed network should only be disabled if no files are being shared.  

Child connections should generally only be disabled on low spec systems or situations where network bandwidth is scarce.  Received search requests are re-broadcast to each child connection, and incoming requests are numerous.  Consider increasing the child limit from the default of 25 on systems with CPU and memory headroom.

Changing these values may require the server connection to be reset, depending on the current state.

| Command Line              | Environment Variable    | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--slsk-no-dnet`          | `SLSK_NO_DNET`          | Determines whether the distributed network is disabled.  If disabled, the client will not obtain a parent or any child connections, and will not receive distributed search requests. |
| `--slsk-dnet-no-children` | `SLSK_DNET_NO_CHILDREN` | Determines whether to disallow distributed children                                                                                                                                   |
| `--slsk-dnet-children`    | `SLSK_DNET_CHILDREN`    | The maximum number of distributed children to accept                                                                                                                                  |
| `--slsk-dnet-logging`     | `SLSK_DNET_LOGGING`     | Determines whether to enable distributed network logging

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  distributed_network:
    disabled: false
    disable_children: false
    child_limit: 25
```

## Listen Port

The port on which the application listens for incoming connections.

As with any other Soulseek client, properly configuring the listen port and port forwarding ensures full connectivity with other clients, including those who have not properly configured a listening port.  

Symptoms of a misconfigured listen port include poor search results and inability to browse or retrieve user information for some users.

| Command Line         | Environment Variable | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--slsk-listen-port` | `SLSK_LISTEN_PORT`   | The port on which to listen for incoming connections |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  listen_port: 50000
```

## Other

| Command Line         | Environment Variable | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--slsk-description` | `SLSK_DESCRIPTION`   | The user description for the Soulseek network |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  description: A slskd user. https://github.com/slskd/slskd
```

## Connection Options

### Timeouts

Timeout options control how long the application waits for connections to connect, and how long connections can be inactive before they are disconnected.

Higher connect timeout values will help ensure that operations (browse, download requests, etc) are successful the first time, but also decrease responsiveness of commands that will ultimately fail.

Inactivity timeouts help the application determine when a distributed parent connection has stopped sending data, and when connections that have delivered search results (and are unlikely to be used further) from remaining open longer than needed.  Reducing this timeout can help on low spec systems if port exhaustion is a concern, but may result in the application "hunting" for a distributed parent connection needlessly.

| Command Line                | Environment Variable      | Description                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--slsk-connection-timeout` | `SLSK_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` | The connection timeout value, in milliseconds    |
| `--slsk-inactivity-timeout` | `SLSK_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` | The connection inactivity value, in milliseconds |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  connection:
    timeout:
      connect: 10000
      inactivity: 15000  
```

### Buffers

Buffer options control the internal buffer the application uses to batch socket reads and writes.  Actual socket buffer sizes are controlled by the OS (.NET is not great in this department currently, and the behavior of these is not consistent cross-platform).

Larger buffer sizes can improve performance, especially for file transfers, but result in increased memory usage.

The transfer buffer size is used for file transfers (both read and write), and the read and write buffer sizes are used for all other connection types.  The transfer buffer size is directly correlated with transfer speed; setting this value much lower than the default will result in slow uploads (which may be a good thing for low spec hardware).

The write queue option is the hard limit for the number of concurrent writes for a connection.  This generally only applies to distributed child connections, and prevents a memory leak if the application continues to try and send data after a connection has gone "bad".  This value can be set as low as 5 if memory is a constraint, though the default has been tested extensively and should be good for most scenarios, including low spec.

| Command Line             | Environment Variable   | Description                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--slsk-read-buffer`     | `SLSK_READ_BUFFER`     | The connection read buffer size, in bytes          |
| `--slsk-write-buffer`    | `SLSK_WRITE_BUFFER`    | The connection write buffer size, in bytes         |
| `--slsk-transfer-buffer` | `SLSK_TRANSFER_BUFFER` | The read/write buffer size for transfers, in bytes |
| `--slsk-write-queue`     | `SLSK_WRITE_QUEUE`     | The connection write buffer size, in bytes         |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  connection:
    buffer:
      read: 16384
      write: 16384
      transfer: 262144
      write_queue: 250    
```

### Proxy

Connections can optionally use a SOCKS5 proxy, with or without username and password authentication.

If the proxy is enabled, an address and port must also be specified.

| Command Line            | Environment Variable  | Description                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--slsk-proxy`          | `SLSK_PROXY`          | Determines whether a proxy is to be used |
| `--slsk-proxy-address`  | `SLSK_PROXY_ADDRESS`  | The proxy address                        |
| `--slsk-proxy-port`     | `SLSK_PROXY_PORT`     | The proxy port                           |
| `--slsk-proxy-username` | `SLSK_PROXY_USERNAME` | The proxy username, if applicable        |
| `--slsk-proxy-password` | `SLSK_PROXY_PASSWORD` | The proxy password, if applicable        |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  connection:
    proxy:
      enabled: false
      address: ~
      port: ~
      username: ~
      password: ~   
```

## Diagnostic Level

The diagnostic level option is passed to the Soulseek.NET configuration, and determines the level of detail at which the library produces diagnostic messages.  This should generally be left set to `Info` or `Warning`, but can be set to `Debug` if more verbose logging is desired.

| Command Line        | Environment Variable | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--slsk-diag-level` | `SLSK_DIAG_LEVEL`    | The minimum diagnostic level (None, Warning, Info, Debug) |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
soulseek:
  diagnostic_level: Info
```

# Web Configuration

## Basic

The default HTTP listen port is 5000, typical for a .NET application, but can be anything between 1 and 65535.

The url base option allows the application to operate behind a reverse proxy. Setting a base of "slskd" would make the web UI accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/slskd`.

The content path can be used to force the application to serve static web content from a location other than the default (`wwwroot`).  The application is designed such that the web UI is decoupled from the rest of the application, and can be swapped for another.

Logging of HTTP requests is disabled by default.

| Command Line      | Environment Variable | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `-l\|--http-port` | `HTTP_PORT`          | The HTTP listen port                              |
| `--url-base`      | `URL_BASE`           | The base url for web requests                     |
| `--content-path`  | `CONTENT_PATH`       | The path to static web content                    |
| `--http-logging`  | `HTTP_LOGGING`       | Determines whether HTTP requests are to be logged |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
web:
  port: 5000
  url_base: /
  content_path: wwwroot
  logging: false
```

## HTTPS

The default HTTPS port is 5001, which again is typical for a .NET application, but can be anything between 1 and 65535.

By default, the application generates a new, self-signed X509 certificate at each startup.  If for whatever reason a self-signed certificate isn't sufficient, or if the certificate needs to be shared among systems or applications, a certificate `.pfx` and password can be defined.

The application can produce a self-signed `.pfx` file and random password using the `--generate-cert` command.

| Command Line            | Environment Variable  | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-L\|--https-port`      | `HTTPS_PORT`          | The HTTPS listen port                                          |
| `-f\|--force-https`     | `HTTPS_FORCE`         | Determines whether HTTP requests are to be redirected to HTTPS |
| `--https-cert-pfx`      | `HTTPS_CERT_PFX`      | The path to the X509 certificate .pfx file                     |
| `--https-cert-password` | `HTTPS_CERT_PASSWORD` | The password for the X509 certificate                          |
| `--no-https`            | `NO_HTTPS`            | Determines whether HTTPS is to be disabled                     |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
web:
  https:
    port: 5001
    force: false
    certificate:
      pfx: ~
      password: ~
```

## Authentication

Authentication for the web UI (and underlying API) is enabled by default, and the default username and password are both `slskd`.  Changing both the username and password during initial configuration are highly recommended.

By default, a random JWT secret key is generated at each start.  This is convenient and secure, but it means that restarting the application will invalidate any issued JWTs, causing users to have to sign in again.  To avoid this supply a custom secret at least 16 characters in length.  Note that the secret can be used to generate valid JWTs for the application, so keep this value secret.

The JWT TTL option determines how long issued JWTs are valid, defaulting to 7 days.

# Filters

A number of filters can be configured to control various aspects of how the application interacts with the Soulseek network.

Share filters can be used to prevent certain types of files from being shared.  This option is an array that can take any number of filters.  Filters must be a valid regular expression; a few examples are included below and in the example configuration included with the application, but the list is empty by default.

Search request filters can be used to discard incoming search requests that match one or more filters.  Like share filters, this option is an array of regular expressions, and it defaults to an empty array (no request filtering is applied).

| Command Line              | Environment Variable    | Description                                                           |

    - \.DS_Store$
  search:
    request:

# Integrations

## FTP

Files can be uploaded to a remote FTP server upon completion.  Files are uploaded to the server and remote path specified using the directory and filename with which they were downloaded; the FTP will match the layout of the local disk.

Uploads are attempted up to the maximum configured retry count, and then discarded.

## Pushbullet

Pushbullet notifications can be sent when a private message is sent, or when the current user's username is mentioned in a chat room.  Notifications are prefixed with a user-definable string to differentiate these notifications from others.  

A Pushbullet account must be created, and users must create an API key within the Pushbullet application and configure it through options. Complete documentation for the Pushbullet API, including the latest instructions for obtaining an API key or "Access Token" can be found [here](https://docs.pushbullet.com/).

The Pushbullet integration is one-way, meaning the application has no way of knowing whether a user is active or receiving notifications.  To prevent an inappropriate number of notifications from being sent, for example, if a user is carrying on an active conversation, a "cooldown" option is provided to ensure that notifications are sent only after the cooldown has expired.  By default, this is every 15 minutes.

Notification API calls are made up to the maximum configured retry count, and then discarded.

| Command Line                          | Environment Variable                   | Description                                                                                        |

# Other Configuration

## Instance Name

The instance name uniquely identifies the running instance of the application.  This is primarily useful for structured logging in cases where multiple instances are logging to the same remote source.

| Command Line          | Environment Variable | Description                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-i\|--instance-name` | `INSTANCE_NAME`      | The unique name for the running instance |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
instance_name: default
```

## Loggers

The application logs to disk (`/logs` in the application directory) by default.  Logs can optionally be forwarded to external services, and the targets can be expanded to any service supported by a [Serilog Sink](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Provided-Sinks).  Support for targets are added on an as-needed basis, and within reason.

The current list of available targets is:

| Command Line | Environment Variable | Description                        |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--loki`     | `LOKI`               | The URL to a Grafana Loki instance |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
logger:
  loki: ~
```

## Metrics

The application captures metrics internally and can optionally expose these metrics to be consumed by an instance of Prometheus.  This is a good option for those wanting to tune performance characterisics of the application.

Metrics are disabled by default, and enabling them will make them available at `/metrics`.  Authentication is enabled by default, and the credentials are the same defaults as the web UI (`slskd`:`slskd`).

If the application will be exposed to the internet, it's a good idea to leave this disabled or to set credentials other than the defaults.  Elements of the system configuration, like operating system, architecture, and drive configuration are included and can this can make it easier for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in your system.


| Command Line         | Environment Variable | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--metrics`          | `METRICS`            | Determines whether the metrics endpoint should be enabled |
| `--metrics-url`      | `METRICS_URL`        | The URL of the metrics endpoint                           |
| `--metrics-no-auth`  | `METRICS_NO_AUTH`    | Disables authentication for the metrics endpoint          |
| `--metrics-username` | `METRICS_USERNAME`   | The username for the metrics endpoint                     |
| `--metrics-password` | `METRICS_PASSWORD`   | The password for the metrics endpoint                     |

#### **YAML**

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: false
  url: /metrics
  authentication:
    disabled: false
    username: slskd
    password: slskd
```

## Features

Several features have been added that aid in the development, debugging and operation of the application, but are generally not of much use to most users.

The application can publish a Swagger (OpenAPI) definition and host SwaggerUI at `/swagger` using [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore).  This is useful for anyone developing against the application API and/or creating a new web interface.

| Command Line   | Environment Variable | Description                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--swagger`    | `SWAGGER`            | Determines whether Swagger (OpenAPI) definitions and UI should be available at `/swagger` |

#### **YAML**
```yaml
feature:
  swagger: false
```

## Development Flags

A number of additional feature flags are provided to change the runtime behavior of the application, which is useful during development.  Available feature flags are:

| Flag                 | Environment Variable | Description                                                      |
